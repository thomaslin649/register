<br />

is-a-dev is a service that allows developers to get a sweet-looking `.is-a.dev` domain for their personal websites.

Note: This service is currently in **beta** so expect some delays in PR merge and report any issues you encounter so that the service can be improved.



## How do I register?
* Fork this project
* Add a `your-domain-name.json` new file in `domains/` directory to register `your-domain-name.is-a.dev`
* [Read the docs for information about the json file](./API.md)
* The PR will be reviewed and merged
* After merging, the changes will take effect within a day
* That's it! Done! Now go show off your cool `.is-a.dev` domain
